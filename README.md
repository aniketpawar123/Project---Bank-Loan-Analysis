### Summary


The Bank Loan Analysis project leverages Excel and PowerPivot to conduct a comprehensive assessment of loan applications, employing key performance indicators (KPIs) to gauge the bank's lending performance. With a total of 38.6K loan applications processed, the project reveals critical insights into the bank's loan portfolio. Notably, the total loan amount extends to $435.8 million, with a corresponding receipt of $473.1 million, indicating a healthy uptake of loans. The average interest rate of 12.05% and the average Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio of 13.33% serve as pivotal metrics in assessing the risk profile of the loan portfolio, aiding in the formulation of prudent lending strategies.

Purpose-based analysis sheds light on the performance of loans across different categories, delineating notable variations in loan quality. While Wedding and Major Purchases loans boast impressive good loan percentages of 90.7% and 90.2%, respectively, the Small Business segment exhibits a comparatively lower good loan percentage of 74.4%. This granular analysis underscores the importance of tailoring risk management strategies to specific loan categories, ensuring optimal portfolio performance and risk mitigation.

The MoM percentage change in loan amounts, depicted through a line chart, unveils nuanced fluctuations in loan volumes over time. Notably, February records a marginal decline of -1.5% in loan amounts, whereas March witnesses a substantial uptick of 16.4% in loan receipts, highlighting the temporal variability inherent in lending activities.

Beyond performance metrics, the analysis delves into loan portfolio quality, with the delineation of good loan percentages at 86.18% and bad loan percentages at 13.82%. This assessment provides crucial insights into the efficacy of credit risk management practices, informing strategic decisions aimed at enhancing asset quality and maintaining robust financial health.

Furthermore, the project incorporates a geographical dimension, utilizing state-wise loan maps to visualize loan distribution across diverse regions. This spatial analysis facilitates a deeper understanding of regional lending dynamics, enabling the identification of potential growth opportunities and risk concentrations.

In summation, the Bank Loan Analysis project serves as a testament to the transformative power of data analytics in informing decision-making processes within the finance and banking sector. By harnessing the capabilities of Excel and PowerPivot, the project offers actionable insights into loan portfolio performance, risk exposure, and geographical dispersion, empowering financial institutions to optimize lending strategies, mitigate risks, and drive sustainable growth.
